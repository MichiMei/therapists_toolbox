The goal of this project was tiallow a therapist and a patient to play learning games or work on work sheets remotely. The project is in a mostly alpha state as deploying it failed due to antivirus programs. The successor of this failed project is tt-online using a website instead. 

Currently only a single activity is implemented called 'Fast-Read' (or 'Blitzwortlesen'). Here the therapist can insert a bunch of text and display selected sections of it (for example single words, phrases or sentences) for a selectable durations (e.g. 100 ms). The selected text will then display on the patients client app for that duration so they can try to read it as fast as possible (not letter by letter but in a more holistic way).

This project will mostlikely never be continued due to the antivirus problems on patient devices and the difficulties to deploy and update it on their devices.
